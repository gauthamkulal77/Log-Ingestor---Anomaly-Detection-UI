Getting Started
  1. Clone the Repository
     git clone https://github.com/gauthamkulal77/log-ingestor.git
     cd log-ingestor

  2. Backend Setup (Flask API)
    
    Navigate to the backend folder:
    cd backend

  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows


  Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

  Create a .env file in backend/ and add:

    MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
    PORT=5000

  Start the backend:

    python app.py
    Runs at: http://localhost:5000

3. Frontend Setup (React)

  pen a new terminal and go to the frontend folder:
  
    cd frontend

  Install dependencies:

    npm install

  Update App.js API URL for local dev:

    const API_URL = "http://localhost:5000";  // Local backend


  In production, replace with your App Engine URL.

Start the frontend:

    npm start

Runs at: http://localhost:3000

Deployment
  Frontend (Firebase Hosting)

  Build production files:

    npm run build


  Deploy to Firebase:

    firebase deploy

Backend (Google App Engine â€“ Flask)

  Deploy to App Engine:

    gcloud app deploy
